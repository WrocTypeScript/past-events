Thanks for the great discussion! These are the questions that were discussed.

- When would you _not_ use TypeScript (when does TypeScript suck)?
- What do you think about `semantic-release`?
- Can I use `microbundle` when I'm targeting Node, or should I go with `tsc`?
- Is using decorators a good practice?
- How do you optimize your app (tree shaking, uglify etc.)
- How to curry in TypeScript?
- Why functional programming does matter even in TypeScript? (Or maybe not?)
- TypeScript vs PureScript
- Does TypeScript retain type information at runtime? Does it have any performance cost?
- Won’t TypeScript slow me down? What’s your experience?
- Why Typescript recommends usage of `interface` for React props, but Flow recommends `type`?
- Isn’t ReasonML better with React than TypeScript?
- Do you like that TSlint became deprecated?
- What do you use for styles? CSS modules, styled components?
